Setup for "How Neural Network Depth Compensates for HMM Conditional Independence Assumptions in DNN-HMM Acoustic Models"

Hi, if you're here, you are probably looking for the code associated with this paper. Unfortunately, since I'm currently on the job market, the code is not sufficiently clean and documented to my standards. I am hoping that this code will be up in the next week or two. If you would like to know when this is ready, please email suman dot v dot ravuri at gmail, and I will ping you when the repo is available. Apologies for the delay and I hope to get the code to you soon.
